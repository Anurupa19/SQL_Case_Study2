# SQL Case Study: Human Resources

## Project Description

The Human Resources SQL Case Study is a hands-on project designed to challenge our SQL skills and deepen our understanding of database management. In this project, we'll explore a database schema consisting of three tables: departments, employees, and projects. Each table contains relevant columns to capture employee details, department information, and project details.

To successfully answer all the questions you should have been exposed to the following areas of SQL:

1. Window Functions like rank, lag
3. Pattern Matching
4. Joins
5. Date time functions
6. CTEs

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective: The main objective of this case study is to apply various SQL concepts and techniques to answer insightful questions about Human Resources. Some of the key objectives include:

1. Find the longest ongoing project for each department.

2. Find all employees who are not managers.

3. Find all employees who have been hired after the start of a project in their department.

4. Rank employees within each department based on their hire date (earliest hire gets the highest rank).

5. Find the duration between the hire date of each employee and the hire date of the next employee hired in the same department.
